### Check-In #2 (Week 11)

##### 1. what youâ€™d hoped to accomplish for this week (i.e., a recap of your goals from the  previous week and your initial proposal) 
###### For this week, the primary goal was to enhance the functionality of my app to allow users to manage their medication events. This included enabling users to add, edit, and delete medication events. Another essential aspect of this week was also to display the current date's medication schedule upon opening the app, providing users with immediate access to their upcoming medications.

##### 2. what you did accomplish for this week, including an assessment of what went faster or  slower than you thought it would 
###### Users can now add, edit, and delete medication events. The functionality for displaying medication events has been implemented, providing users with a more organized view of their medication schedule. However, the main challenge this week was understanding how to utilize the main storyboard to display the current date's medication schedule after opening the app.

##### 3. what you hope to accomplish for next week
###### My top priority will be to continue experimenting with the main storyboard to determine how to display the current date's medication schedule. I will also be directing my attention toward implementing reminders and notifications for medication events.
